# machine_learning_mini_projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning
mini-projects that I have used to learn/apply/test various machine
learning algorithms and tools.

## Projects

#### Time series with LSTM on meteorological data <br /> 
     Time series prediction using LSTM in TensorFlow on monthly average temperature in England from 1723-1970.  
     
     ML Algorithms: 
     -LSTM
     
#### Classification on spiral dataset <br />
     Classification on 2D spiral dataset using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
     
     ML Algorithms: 
     -K Nearest Neighbors
     -SVM with Gaussian RBF
     -Multi-layer Neural Network  
     
#### Deep neural network from scratch <br />
     Deep neural network from scratch (i.e. using Numpy)
     
     ML Algorithms:
     -Multi-layer Neural Network

#### Regression on Ames, Iowa house prices <br />
     Various regression techniques applied to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa 
     using Scikit-learn.
     
     ML Algorithms: 
     -Regression (Ordinary, Ridge, Elastic Net)
     -Random Forest
     -Gradient Boosting
     
#### Transfer learning with deep neural network <br />
     Apply transfer learning to MNIST using deep neural network in TensorFlow:
     -train initial model on full MNIST data set for digits 0-4. 
     -use pre-trained hidden layers to train new model on a very small subset of digits 5-9. Specifically, freeze the bottom layer from the 0-4 digit model and allow higher layers to train for 5-9 model. 
     
     ML Algorithms: 
     -Neural network

#### word2vec on TED talks <br />
     word2vec on TED talks with t-SNE visualization in TensorFlow.
     
     ML Algorithms:
     -word2vec
     
#### Simple linear regression in TensorFlow
     Very simple linear regression implemented while learning TensorFlow.
     
     ML Algorithms:
     -Linear Regression
